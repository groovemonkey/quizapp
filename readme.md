###YOU WERE JUST WORKING ON:

- deleteAnswerFromQuestion in bootstrap.js (mongo query for deleting)
    (bootstrap.js, line 71) -- how to get mongo to delete the given answer object?


###TODO:

- A form for creating/adding quizzes

- A way of scoring quizzes
- A way of taking quizzes




A user has a record of all quizzes taken and made.
For each quiz taken, there is a record of choices and the last calculated score.

###Possible bugs:
categories can't have spaces?
rationale for saving object at every input: categories must be visible in multiple places (simultaneous input + output)
