YOU WERE JUST WORKING ON:

  -updating questions (with MORE search parameters than just _id) doesn't work anymore...wtf?
  -building-quiz template


TODO:

- A form for creating/adding quizzes
    -- event for 'click #btnSaveAnswer' (saving answers to DB)
    -- event for 'click #btnSaveQuestion' (saving questions to DB)

- A way of scoring quizzes










Quiz -->
    Categories
    Questions --> Answers


A user has a record of all quizzes taken and made.
For each quiz taken, there is a record of choices and the last calculated score.
User -->

Possible bugs:
##categories can't have spaces?
rationale for saving object at every input: categories must be visible in multiple places (simultaneous input + output)
